## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to give developers an easy way to embed an emulator onto their website.

## How it Works

EmulatorJS is a backend service that hosts its [selection of emulators](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/tree/main/docs/Systems) that may be embedded into your website. This is not an all-in-one stand alone server.
