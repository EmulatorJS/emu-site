#### *Q:* Why was I re-directed/sent to this page?

***A:*** Because I don't have the time to personally help every person out there, and your issue is likely documented here.

#### *Q:* I'm getting "Network Error" when trying to play. What do I do.

***A:*** Try the following:
- **Use a web server**. You cannot just open the html file.
- Clear your cache
- Update your data folder
- If using jsdeliver, ensure you have an up to date url.
- If using replit, don't. Replit doesn't support this and will block certian files.

If the issue still occurs, open an issue containing a screenshot of the network tab within dev-tools.
