# Roadmap
* Assist libretro with developing their cores and eventually implementing [retroachievements](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/retroachievements/)

Note: These are goals are not in any specific order, nor do they have estimated dates to completion. The only thing that is for certain is that they will be completed sooner as more people contribute to this and [libretro's](https://retroarch.com/index.php?page=donate) projects.
