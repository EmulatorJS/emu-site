# 3rd Party Projects

EmulatorJS itself is built to be a plugin, rather than an entire website. This is why there is no docker container of this project. There are several projects you can use, that use EmulatorJS!

## RomM: Your beautiful, powerful, self-hosted rom manager.

You can view more about this project, at https://romm.app/

## Gaseous Server: ROM and title management, with some basic in browser emulation.

## EmulatorJS GameLibrary Extension

Our friend [Ramaerel](https://github.com/Ramaerel/emulatorjs-GameLibrary) is developing the EmulatorJS GameLibrary Extension.

* This add-on reads the contents of your ROM folders and uses it to display the games library. ROMs with common endings (like .iso, .bin or .zip), must also include the applicable extension before it. A list is included in this readme with the additional extensions, and will be updated as I go.

```txt
Example: [game].[system].[file extension]
Sample: Crash Bandicoot.psx.zip
```

To use systems that require a bios, like psx, add the bios under the BIOS folder and name it according to the system and ending with .bin

```txt
Example: psx.bin
```

* Installation (wip)

This is a drag and drop extension, with the exception that it requires something to host PHP files like XAMPP. Put your roms in the /roms/ folder and bios in the /bios/ folder, following the above naming scheme.
