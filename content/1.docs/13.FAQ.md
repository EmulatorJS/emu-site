# FAQ

#### *Q:* Why was I re-directed/sent to this page?

***A:*** Because I don't have the time to personally help every person out there, and your issue is likely documented here.

#### *Q:* How can I embed this using Replit

***A:*** You don't. Replit does not support this.

#### *Q:* I'm getting "Network Error" when trying to play. What do I do?

***A:*** Try the following:
- **Use a web server**. You cannot just open the HTML file.
- Clear your cache.
- Update your data folder.
- If using jsDelivr, ensure you have an up-to-date URL.
- If using Replit, don't. Replit doesn't support this and will block certain files.
- If using GitHack, try using jsDelivr. Githack will serve outdated resources.

If the issue still occurs, open an issue containing a screenshot of the network tab within dev-tools.

#### *Q:* Why is my PlayStation game crashing?

***A:*** The game is likely too big to be run in the web browser. This cannot currently be fixed.

#### *Q:* Is netplay supported? How do I enable netplay?

#### *Q:* I'm encountering CORS errors while trying to run the emulator. How can I resolve this?

***A:*** CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors occur when a web page running in one domain tries to access resources (like scripts or assets) from another domain. To resolve CORS errors. Ensure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header is set on the remote server, and is the correct value.

#### *Q:* I'm seeing an error that says "SharedArrayBuffer is not defined." How do I fix this?

***A:*** The "SharedArrayBuffer is not defined" error will occur if the following headers are not set. This is because the SharedArrayBuffer feature is very powerful. Ensure you are using https and that your server is sending the headers below.

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

#### *Q:* Is this linuxservers EmulatorJS docker project?

***A:*** No. But Gaseous is great alternative: [Gaseous](https://github.com/gaseous-project/gaseous-server)

#### *Q:* Is there a docker version of this project?

***A:*** The sponsored docker version of this project is the "gaseous" project. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/gaseous-project/gaseous-server) on github, and you can join the gaseous discord server [here](https://discord.gg/WQwRgAWDEM).

#### *Q:* Why is the demo the only official EmulatorJS instance?

***A:*** This project isn't meant to be a website to go to and play games. This project is meant for developers to use to embed into their site to host games. If a feature isn't on the demo that is found in other places of the project, it's because its a **demo**.

#### *Q:* What should I include when I open an issue?

***A:*** You should include as much as you know. The issue, and logs. If you don't have access to the console, there is likely a reason, and it is likely that reason is also causing an issue with other things.
